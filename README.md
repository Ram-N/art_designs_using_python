These notebooks are used for workshop on "Creating Art Designs using Python"

The workshop consists of helper code (to learn the concepts) and a set of Exercises.
THese exercises are designed to be increasingly difficult, as they build on the previous modules.

`flower of life` is one place to start.

Note that it is helpful (but not mandatory) that you know Python. As a matter of choice we use the Matplotlib module for all plotting.
There are many other good choices for plotting.

All the notebooks in this workshop are `Binder`-enabled, which means that you can run the code from your browser *without* downloading anything. The goal is to get to coding with minimal friction. Click the binder button above to try it out.

If you run into any problems please consider reporting an `issue.`
